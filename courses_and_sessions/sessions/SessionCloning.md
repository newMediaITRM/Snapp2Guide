# Session cloning

Session cloning is one of the most useful tools of Snapp2 Session module. It can save a lot of time. Because of this you donâ€™t have to a create a desired session from scratch

## To clone session:
* Go to Session in Courses & Sessions module
* Find the session you want to clone


```php
Tip! On the right top corner there is the Search box, just type the name of the session you are looking for. 
You can also sort sessions by Id (click the arrows icons next to Id word) this way you can see the sessions recently added.
You can also sort by "Starts date" or "Available From date", or by Title that will help you to find your session faster. 
```
