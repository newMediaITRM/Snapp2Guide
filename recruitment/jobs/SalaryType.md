# Salary type

There are two ways to deal with setting up a salary for the job offer. 
  

* **Min/Max**

We can set up a Salary Min and a Salary Max. The Duration field is not mandatory so would not need to be populated.
 Salary Min/Max does not appear on the job offer.  



* **Label**

We can specify Salary Value, this value will appear on the job offer (example: £45,000 - £50,000 per annum)
