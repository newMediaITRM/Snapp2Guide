under the image in Media Library (pic 1). 
To find that name go to the chosen slider in Hero Unit and click "Attach Image", Media Library will appear on the screen, you will see your image 
then you can copy the name. 
Close Hero Unit and go back to Media Library, paste copied name into "Filter Images" box and click "Search".
