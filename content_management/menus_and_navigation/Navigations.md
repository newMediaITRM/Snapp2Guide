# Navigations

Snapp2 has flexible and simple editing functionality regarding positioning of pages relating to its parent menu. 
This allows you full control in terms of what menu a page is located in and your ability to change that easily by simply click and dragging. 
This is easy to do and undo.

## Managing urls

Sometimes a page can carry a very long url. This is not practical if you need to use the url on promotional materials (in social media ect).  
In Menus & Navigation you can very easily create a short url for a page. 

For example we have a website url https://cact.org.uk/what-we-do/social-action-and-enterprise  - this would be too long for a facebook campaign.
We would like to change it to https://cact.org.uk/social

To change a url:
* Go to Menus & Navigation in the Content Management
* Find the page of which you wish to change the url, click Edit button 
* Write the text that you would like your url to be replaced with in the Friendly URL field (for example '**social**') and press Save Navigation

Now your page will be accessible from https://cact.org.uk/**social** only.
